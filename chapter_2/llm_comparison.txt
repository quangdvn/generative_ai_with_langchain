==================================================================================================
While OpenAI's models remain influential, the LLM ecosystem has rapidly diversified, 
offering developers multiple options for their applications. 
To maintain clarity, we'll separate LLMs from the model gateways that provide access to them.

==================================================================================================
Key LLM families

Anthropic Claude: Excels in reasoning, long-form content processing, and vision analysis with up to 200K token context windows

Mistral models: Powerful open-source models with strong multilingual capabilities and exceptional reasoning abilities

Google Gemini: Advanced multimodal models with industry-leading 1M token context window and real-time information access

OpenAI GPT-o: Leading omnimodal capabilities accepting text, audio, image, and video with enhanced reasoning

DeepSeek models: Specialized in coding and technical reasoning with state-of-the-art performance on programming tasks

AI21 Labs Jurassic: Strong in academic applications and long-form content generation

Inflection Pi: Optimized for conversational AI with exceptional emotional intelligence

Perplexity models: Focused on accurate, cited answers for research applications

Cohere models: Specialized for enterprise applications with strong multilingual capabilities

==================================================================================================
Cloud provider gateways

Amazon Bedrock: Unified API access to models from Anthropic, AI21, Cohere, Mistral, and others with AWS integration

Azure OpenAI Service: Enterprise-grade access to OpenAI and other models with robust security and Microsoft ecosystem integration

Google Vertex AI: Access to Gemini and other models with seamless Google Cloud integration

==================================================================================================
Independent platforms

Together AI: Hosts 200+ open-source models with both serverless and dedicated GPU options

Replicate: Specializes in deploying multimodal open-source models with pay-as-you-go pricing

HuggingFace Inference Endpoints: Production deployment of thousands of open-source models with fine-tuning capabilities‚Äù

================================================================================
These parameters work together to shape model output:

Temperature + Top-k/Top-p: First, Top-k/Top-p filter the token distribution, and then temperature affects randomness within that filtered set
Penalties + Temperature: Higher temperatures with low penalties can produce creative but potentially repetitive text
